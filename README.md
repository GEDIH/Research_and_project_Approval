2	BUSINESS PROPOSAL
2.1	Features
2.1.1	Content Management and Content Publishing
In this project, the merging of our technical software team and UI/UX team to rebrand and setup the design framework for the new Food Delivery Mobile App Backend Admin in PHP-Laravel platform. PHP- Laravel serves as a CMS (Content Management System) which streamlines the creation, publishing and management of content on Food Delivery Mobile App. User has the ownership of the content, which means user has the ability to post new content, update current content, and archive outdated content from the portal. In another words, content requires frequent updates can be easily handled by World Wellness users in future. Such as:
•	News & Announcement
•	Latest Product
•	Categories
•	Store Location
•	Manufacturers
•	Product Variant
•	Stock Management
•	Order Summary
•	Departments info, organization hierarchy and contact information

2.1.2	Admin Analytical Dashboard
To better understand the visitors of the Mobile App, a simple profiling will be introduced, to collect personal data such as gender, age range and location for analysis purposes. These personal data can be collected via quick questionnaire, or social media logins. With this information available, we can show browsing guides or suggest related contents to the site visitors.
A traffic analysis dashboard will be implemented in the new Food Delivery Admin portal, which can assist World Wellness Admins to identify the trends and traffic in the Food delivery Mobile App. Information on number of visitors, traffic sources, user segments and navigation behavior will help World Wellness to evaluate the type of information the visitors are engaged to and interested in.


  
 
2.2	Key Users Roles
Food Delivery Mobile App Admin Portal built in PHP-Laravel will have 2 major user roles:
•	Content Contributor
o	For content owner such as HR and marketing team to contribute the Mobile App content (such as news & announcement, vacancies, project details, training details etc) in real-time, with intuitive interfaces and drag-and-drop content authoring and layout capabilities designed for the non-technical users
•	Administrator
o	Analyzes visitor traffic, and measures website effectiveness.
o	To perform analysis and fine tuning on the targeting segments
o	Manage and assign content contributors

2.3	UI/UX Design
The design solution shall encompass the delivery of a brand-new digital user experience across all digital channels (such as web / mobile and tablets).
 


For the customer, the outcome will be an easy to navigate, read, find, transact, and apply intuitive design which is accessible from various digital channels – desktop, tablets and smartphones. The digital channels will provide a superior user experience that is available anytime, anywhere; a source of customer acquisition and activation, with clear call-to-actions. Superior user experience could be, but not necessarily limited to, shortened or simplified processes and steps.
 

Expected design outcomes:

•	Fully responsive design across all modern devices
Work with the team to arrive at a responsive design strategy/approach including how the content will behave on different screen sizes. The minimum and maximum screen resolutions will be provided. The design should start with the small screen and then progressive scale up to larger screens and enhance the experience.

•	Simplified user journeys
Relook at the existing user flows and find opportunities to reduce all possible frictions and the time taken to complete the journeys.

•	Retain our conceptual IA/Navigation model
We would like to continue to use the successful high level IA (Information Architecture). Most (if not all) functions in scope should be categorized under these existing categories.

•	Align with Ethiopia Brand guidelines.
For things like the main navigation bar and the way information in presented should all align to the global
Ethiopia Brand guidelines.

•	Scalability and reusability of designs
We need the designs to scale up and adapt for additional new products and features in the near future.

2.3.2	Emerging Web & Mobile Technology Trends

 

2.3.3	Approach
We aim to put users at the center of everything and create brand experience, which connects, engages, promotes dialogue and delivers tangible benefits to World Wellness. The success of this project lies in agile methodology. Our think, create, release and engage strategy will be the pillars of this engagement blending various components for a holistic solution


As explained in the above diagram we will set clear objective for business, will understand the needs and wants of the end customer alongside ensuring World Wellness brand is highly reflected in the work we produce.

We will follow agile methodology and refined experience to ensure the shortest design cycle with quality outcome. We will provide user journeys for defined platforms to demonstrate the treatment and adaptability on different platforms.

Guiding principles for the Project
I have been working in past and keeping up with the pace and need of users that eliminates the need of designing multiple apps for different platforms. Responsive Design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user’s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation. As the user switches from their Tablets to Mobile, the application should automatically switch to accommodate for resolution, image size and scripting abilities. In other words, the application should have the technology to automatically respond to the user’s preferences. This would eliminate the need for a different design and development phase for each new gadget on the market.

   ## Story **
   The reason for developing this application is that often people in this big city doing their normal work do not find many problems of voluntarily ordering food from places or hotels, this is because the restaurant is far from their workplace. to solve this problem, more people can order food from anywhere using their mobile phones at their workplace.
